an activity is 1 full screen page of your application therefor a fragments can be composite in an activity
fragments where created so that we can have fully working reusable components with in activities so that we
can easily resuse those parts somewhere else (google fragments vs activities android) instead of
copying and pasting the same code logic for different components
